# Classification-Project-CS-3203-SP25
The main info and code repository for Group E's project, Classification.

Classification is a Learning Management System (LMS) that seeks to provide students, educators, and administrators with a more streamlined, easy-to-use interface. 

In addition to course and classroom management, Classification will provide many features aimed at improving quality-of-life. These include:
* Curriculum uploads for educators and curriculum review for administrators or department heads
* Comparison of student performance and curriculum material to state/national standards
* AI evaluations of students' work and educators' lesson plans
* Chatbot assistance for both teachers and students

## Installation

Classification was initially envisioned as a website, but we believe that an application would be extremely beneficial towards ease of use. As such please ensure that the following are installed prior to installation of this product:
* C++23 is the most recent and optimal version, but backwards compatibility down to C++17 is supported
* A C++ IDE, such as Eclipse or VSCode (Our recommendation is VSCode. To aquire it, go here: https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* C/C++ and C/C++ Extension pack for VSCode (If you are using VSCode)

To install Classification itself:
* Clone the repository: https://github.com/CDMill04/Classification-Project-CS-3203-SP25.git
* Once you have the zip file, extract it
* Save the file where your C++ IDE can open it
